# TwitterReader
This app lets you read tweets that mentions you and make a certain action after that.

If you are going to run the app, you need the twitter credentials for developer, you can get the credentials from this site:
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api

This is just a demo so you can put the credentials on the AppSettings so you won't need to change them by code.
The variables that you need to change are: apiKey, apiKeySecret, accessToken, accessTokenSecret on the Main Form.

Note: This app was made with Devexpress just for visual demo purposes, you can take the code and make it on simple winforms without the need of DevExpress.
